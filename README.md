### Hi there 👋 My Name is Achraf MOUDDEN , I am a Computer Science Engineer and a FullStack Java/Angular Developer.

A software engineer fascinated by Information technology and the ocean of the web, I went through the marvels of this breathtaking digital world with a lot of opportunities to be part of many creative projects&start-ups and worked on many exciting projects that shaped my knowledge and gave meaning to my academic and professional achievements.

The experiences, experiments, and challenges that I went through during my high-education journey gave me a clear vision of what I know, what I want, and most importantly about what motivates me the most.

Creative, Methodical, and thirsty-to-learn engineer that focuses on problem-solving and thinking out-of-the-box which ultimately makes me interested in the changes that happen every day in the IT-sector and proposing solutions to them-unsolved problems, or thinking of improvements of the already-made solutions.

IT enthusiast

I hope to learn a lot, to make a lot of mistakes, and learn even more from them!

Ask me Anything! :)
